# week-2-assignment-gallery

This weeks assignment was more challenging. I didnt find the html or the css that difficult, but getting the logic right for the javascript functions was much more challenging and took me several hours and a lot of research to get correct. In the end, i managed to meet all of the requirements and even added some buttons, but i didnt get a chance to hide the thumbnails from the screen to improve the view of the display, or to have the images transition more smoothly.
